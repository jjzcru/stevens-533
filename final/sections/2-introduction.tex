\section{Introduction}

There are multiple open-source projects out in the open, especially on Github, which house over 100 million projects \cite{intro}, but we want to narrow our scope to the front-end because is an easy path to introduce a new contributor and also the impact of the collaboration will affect the lives of multiple developers and even more, the users of this applications.

In this paper we are going to focus on the main four front-end frameworks, this paper target potential first-time contributors, and can we help them to suggest which framework to choose to contribute, we are going to achieve this by taking a look into the projects and the communities that are built around them.
