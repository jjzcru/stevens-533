\section{Introduction}

We want to focus on the front-end because it is a simple way for a new contributor to get involved, despite many open-source projects available on Github (over 100 million projects\cite{intro}). Even more importantly, the collaboration will have a significant impact on the lives of several developers and, as a result, their customers.

We will focus on the four most popular front-end frameworks, as well as the projects and communities built around them throughout this paper, to help potential first-time contributors decide which framework to use.
