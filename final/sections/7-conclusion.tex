\section{Conclusion}
Most modern software developers depend heavily on open source tools and libraries. But relatively few contribute back to open source.
As most of them have a tough time on choosing which project to contribute to as Open source projects are highly dynamic. 
Every open source community is different. Each community has different people in it with different roles and rewards offered. 

Most of them contributing  to the projects generally look into a few important questions before they decide to contribute (i.e) When was the latest commit done? Was it recent? (That is, is the project actively maintained/worked on?), How many contributions does it have?, How often do people make commits?. 
In this paper we have added a lot more layers to these questions and trying to help those who want to contribute by trying to estimate the life of a project and activeness of the community.

Upon examining the four different projects that are(Vue, React, Angular and Svelte). It was clearly seen that Angular looked the most promising one among all of them, this necessarily doesn’t mean that the other three have an inactive community but just as Vue and Svelte are relatively newer than angular, lot more people are coming to get a hold of the newer languages, as there has been a gradual increase in their activity. 
Though React had the highest number of users, it’s activity has been on the decline and this can be attributed to the maturity of the framework.
