\section{Conclusion}
Although open source looks challenging, especially in the beginning, working on it will increase the skills of any developers while also providing a community on which the developer could rely, every open source community is different. Each community has different people in it with different roles and rewards offered. 

Angular, Vue and Svelte have been increasing in their commits and community, while React has been declining but this would be a sign of maturity rather than a dying project, after all, is back by Facebook and it's an integral part of their ecosystem.

We also layout a potential use case for the project and how the community analysis could be improved to better depict how the communities interact outside of GitHub.
