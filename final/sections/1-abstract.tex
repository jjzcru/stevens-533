\section{Abstract}
You may be wondering how to contribute to an open-source project, whether because you have a particular interest in open source or because it's a great way to build a portfolio for potential employers.

Because front-end developers are in high demand, this paper will look at what sets one project apart from another.

We hope to shed light on the most popular frameworks (react, vue, angular, and svelte) and their communities by publishing this paper.

After all, one of the fundamental pillars on which open source projects can thrive is a strong community.
