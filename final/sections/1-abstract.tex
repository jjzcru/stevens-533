\section{Abstract}
As a new developer, you may be wondering how to contribute to an open-source project, whether because you have a particular interest in open source or because it's a great way to build a portfolio for potential employers.

There has been an increase in demand for front-end developers in the last year, so here are some pointers to get you started. It also includes several frameworks from which to choose.

We hope that by publishing this paper, we can provide some insight into the most popular frameworks (react, vue, angular, and svelte) and their communities. 

After all, one of the fundamental pillars on which open source projects can thrive is a strong community.
