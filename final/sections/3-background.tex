\section{Background and Motivation}
\subsection{Background}
When a developer wishes to start its journey as a contributor, they don't know how to begin, we suggest choosing one of the suggested front-end frameworks, it will not only increase the developer's skills but will also help with the interaction with other contributors.

This kind of interaction provides, give first-time contributors access to developers with far more experience which in turn will help them to find more opportunities outside of the scope of the project.
