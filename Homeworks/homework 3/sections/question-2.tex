\section{How many staff weeks of effort to you estimate?}
Getting the environmental factors we have 4 items from F1-F6 and 2 from F7-F8 that give us a total of 6, using the (Schneider and Winters) approximation would be \newline\newline

\textbf{PF = 36 hrs/UCP }\newline\newline

\noindent
And we asume 40 hours per week (HPW) \newline\newline


\textbf{Effort = (PF * UCP) / HPW = (36 * 59.1) / 40 = 53 staff week}
